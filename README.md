# FINAL-PROJECT – Simple Banking System(MEEBank)

## Introduction

This project is a **desktop banking system** developed using **C# WinForms** and **SQLite** as part of an academic final project. The goal of the system is to demonstrate basic banking operations, user management, and database integration in a clean and structured way.

The application allows users to log in securely, manage bank accounts, perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and view complete transaction histories. All data is stored locally using SQLite, and the system automatically creates the required database and tables on first run.

This project focuses on applying core programming concepts such as:

* Desktop application development with WinForms
* Database persistence using SQLite
* Repository pattern for data access
* Basic authentication with hashed passwords
* User-friendly and themed graphical interface(UI)

This system is intended for **educational purposes only** and is not meant for real-world banking use.
